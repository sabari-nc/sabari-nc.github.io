### ðŸŒ± About Me:
I specialize in monitoring landslides and assessing slope stability within mountainous regions prone to anthropogenic impacts. My work extensively involves applying geophysical techniques, specifically ground pulsation studies. I actively contribute to developing mitigation strategies, utilizing bioengineering and various engineering practices to address environmental challenges. My involvement extends to research in the fields of micropaleontology (Foraminifera) and environmental geochemistry.
